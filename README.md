## 🔰 What is `useReducer`?
`useReducer` is a **React Hook** that’s used to manage **more complex state logic** in a component — especially when:

- The **state depends on previous state**
- Multiple **actions** can update the state
- You want to **centralize your state logic**, like in Redux, but without using Redux

## 🚀 Beginner: `useReducer` vs `useState` 
### 🤔 When to use `useState`?
- Simple states: toggles, inputs, flags, counters
```
const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
```
### 🤔 When to use `useReducer`?
- Complex states (like objects or multiple related values)
- When you have **multiple types of actions**
- State changes depend on **previous state**
## ✅ Basic Syntax
```js
const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(reducer, initialState);
```
### 🔹 Components:
- `state` : current state
- `dispatch` : function to send an action
- `reducer` : function to update the state
- `initialState` : starting value

## ⚙️ Intermediate: Manage Complex States
```js
const initialState = {
  name: '',
  email: '',
  isLoggedIn: false,
};
```
## 🧠 Advanced: Replacing Redux in Localized Components
You can use `useReducer` in big projects **in place of Redux** if:

- The state is **only needed inside one component or a component tree**
- You don’t want the overhead of Redux for local state
- You want predictable state updates like Redux, but without global store

## 📦 useReducer with `Context API` → Global State (Alternative to Redux)
-```js
// GlobalState.js
```
## 🚀 Why & When to Use `useReducer` in Big Projects
| Situation | <p>Choose </p><p> When…</p> |
| ----- | ----- |
| Local state management | <p>You want Redux-like behavior but </p><p>**only locally**</p><p> inside a component</p> |
| State depends on previous | Like undo/redo, toggling, or step-based wizards |
| Multiple actions | <p>Too many </p><p> calls cluttering your component</p> |
| You don’t want Redux overhead | Small/medium projects where Redux is too much |
| Complex forms | With dynamic inputs, nested updates, validation flags |

## ⚔️ `useReducer` vs Redux vs `useState` 
| Feature | useState | useReducer | Redux Toolkit |
| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| Simplicity | ✅ Best | ⚠️ Medium | ❌ Complex |
| Complex logic | ❌ Not great | ✅ Good | ✅ Best |
| Global state | ❌ No | ✅ With Context | ✅ Built-in |
| Async handling | ❌ No | ❌ Manual | ✅ Built-in |
---

## 📌 Summary
| Level | What to Learn |
| ----- | ----- |
| Beginner | Understand reducer functions, dispatch, and simple examples |
| Intermediate | Use with objects, multiple actions |
| Advanced | Use with Context API for global state, replace Redux for small apps |

Give you a useReducer + Context API project template?🤔

## 📦 Project Structure
```
src/
├── context/
│   └── GlobalState.jsx
├── components/
│   ├── Login.jsx
│   └── UserInfo.jsx
├── App.jsx
└── index.jsx
```
## ✅ What This Template Gives You
- Global state without Redux
- Central `dispatch()`  like Redux
- Easy to scale: add more actions, handle loading, errors, etc.
- Works in both small and medium-large apps
